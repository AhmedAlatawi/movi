## Commit message

Here's a commit message example including *tag*, *title* and *description*:

```
[MOD] redirect user to WatchedView after adding movies

User is now redirected to the "watched movies" section so he can see
the new movie has been correcly added to the list.
This is far a better experience than redirect him to the home page.
```
